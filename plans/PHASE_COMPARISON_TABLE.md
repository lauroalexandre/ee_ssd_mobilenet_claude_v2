**Pattern:** Phases with 100% Exit1 (1.2, 1.4, 1.7) have Exit1 confidence 0.47-0.50. Phases with 0% early exits have Exit1 confidence < 0.20.

### Training Loss Values

| Phase | Total Loss | Exit1 Loss | Exit2 Loss | Full Loss | Cascade Loss |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|-----------|--------------|
| 1.1   | 0.025      | 0.076      | 0.000      | 0.000     | 0.038        |
| 1.2   | 357.3      | 330.5      | 314.5      | 441.3     | 0.179        |
| 1.3   | 359.6      | 331.9      | 316.2      | 445.1     | 0.195        |
| 1.4   | 360.8      | 331.4      | 319.1      | 445.7     | 0.184        |
| 1.5   | 360.2      | 331.3      | 318.0      | 445.3     | 0.172        |

| 1.7   | 359.5      | 333.8      | 316.9      | 441.7     | 0.188        |
| 1.8   | 360.3      | 332.0      | 317.7      | 445.2     | 0.166        |
| 1.9   | 447.3      | 333.4      | 317.3      | 440.7     | 0.157        |

**Note:** Phase 1.1 used different loss formulation (much lower values). Phases 1.2-1.9 have similar loss ranges (330-450), indicating similar training dynamics.

### Temperature Values (Final)

| Phase | Temp1 | Temp2 | Temp_Full | Stability |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 1.1   | 1.50  | 1.50  | 1.00      | Stable (defaults) |
| 1.2   | 1.64  | 1.42  | 0.91      | Stable ✅ |
| 1.3   | 1.64  | 1.65  | 0.87      | Stable ✅ |
| 1.4   | 1.54  | 1.62  | 0.91      | Stable ✅ |
| 1.5   | 1.56  | 1.59  | 0.89      | Stable ✅ |
| 1.6   | 1.24  | 2.56  | 0.65      | Temp2 high ⚠️ |
| 1.7   | **24.56** | 1.71  | 0.59      | **Temp1 exploded!** ❌ |
| 1.8   | 1.55  | 2.15  | 0.50      | Moderate ⚠️ |
| 1.9   | 1.17  | **3.00** | 0.94      | **Temp2 maxed out!** ❌ |

**Critical Issue:** Phases without temperature clamping (1.7, 1.9) show runaway values, indicating training instability.

## Timeline of Approaches

### Phase 1.1: Baseline (First Attempt)
**Date:** Oct 6
**Approach:** Detection-quality-based confidence (objectness > 0.5, min 3 objects)
**Result:** 0% early exits (gates too strict)
**Key Learning:** Quality gates prevent model from practicing early exits

### Phase 1.2: Lower Thresholds
**Date:** Oct 6
**Approach:** Simple fixed thresholds (0.40, 0.50)
**Result:** 100% Exit1, 8.1ms inference
**Key Learning:** Simple approach works, but is it too simple?

### Phase 1.3: Higher Thresholds
**Date:** Oct 6
**Approach:** Raise thresholds (0.65, 0.80) based on Phase 1.2 confidence
**Result:** 0% early exits (overcorrection)
**Key Learning:** Can't just copy training confidence to inference thresholds

### Phase 1.4: Calibrated Thresholds
**Date:** Oct 7
**Approach:** Set thresholds (0.45, 0.60) to match observed confidence
**Result:** 100% Exit1, 8.2ms (same as 1.2)
**Key Learning:** Same result as 1.2, but now with **detection quality validated = broken**

### Phase 1.5: Learned Thresholds
**Date:** Oct 6 (between 1.2 and 1.3)
**Approach:** Make thresholds learnable parameters
**Result:** 0% early exits (learned wrong values: 0.55, 0.65)
**Key Learning:** Model can't learn good thresholds during training

### Phase 1.6: Differentiable Routing
**Date:** Oct 6
**Approach:** Gumbel-Softmax for differentiable exit selection
**Result:** 0% early exits (routing didn't help)
**Key Learning:** More sophistication doesn't solve fundamental issues

### Phase 1.7: Progressive Thresholds
**Date:** Oct 6
**Approach:** Start low (0.25, 0.35), increase to (0.45, 0.60)
**Result:** 100% Exit1, **5.8ms** (fastest!), but Temp1=24.6
**Key Learning:** Fastest result but unstable - needs temp clamping

### Phase 1.8: Warmup + Stricter Quality
**Date:** Oct 6
**Approach:** 3 warmup epochs, then activate quality gates
**Result:** 0% early exits (gates too strict)
**Key Learning:** Even with warmup, quality gates kill early exits

### Phase 1.9: Relaxed Gates + Warmup
**Date:** Oct 6
**Approach:** Lower requirements (2 objects, 0.6 threshold), longer warmup
**Result:** 0% early exits (still too strict)
**Key Learning:** Warmup data shows confidence crashes when gates activate

## Success vs. Failure Patterns

### Successful Phases (Fast Inference)

**Phases 1.2, 1.4, 1.7:** Common characteristics:
- ✅ Simple fixed threshold routing
- ✅ No quality gates during inference
- ✅ Exit1 confidence: 0.47-0.50
- ✅ Inference time: 5.8-8.2ms
- ⚠️ **But detection quality unknown until Phase 1.4 validation**

### Failed Phases (Slow Inference)

**Phases 1.1, 1.3, 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 1.9:** Common characteristics:
- ❌ Complex quality controls or learned parameters
- ❌ Strict quality gates during inference
- ❌ Exit1 confidence: 0.00-0.33
- ❌ Inference time: 14-21ms
- ❌ No early exit practice during training

## What Each Phase Tried to Solve

| Phase | Problem Identified | Solution Attempted | Result |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|--------|
| 1.1   | N/A (baseline) | Detection quality gates | Too strict ❌ |
| 1.2   | 1.1 too strict | Lower thresholds | Works ✅ but suspicious |
| 1.3   | 1.2 all exit early | Raise thresholds | Too high ❌ |
| 1.4   | 1.3 none exit | Calibrate thresholds | Same as 1.2 ⚠️ |
| 1.5   | Fixed thresholds suboptimal | Learn thresholds | Learns wrong values ❌ |
| 1.6   | Hard routing not differentiable | Gumbel-Softmax | Doesn't help ❌ |
| 1.7   | Need balanced distribution | Progressive schedule | Fast but unstable ⚠️ |
| 1.8   | Temp instability | Warmup + clamping | Gates still too strict ❌ |
| 1.9   | 1.8 gates too harsh | Relax gates + warmup | Still fails ❌ |

**Pattern:** Each phase tried to fix the symptom (exit distribution) without addressing the root cause (broken detection training).

## Critical Insights from Phase 1.9 Warmup

Phase 1.9 included 3 warmup epochs before activating quality gates. The progression is revealing:

| Epoch | Quality Gates | Exit1 Conf | Exit2 Conf | Exit Distribution | Inference Time |
|-------|---------------|------------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1-3   | **OFF**       | 0.41       | 0.48       | 100% Exit1        | 6ms ✅         |
| 4     | **ON**        | 0.09       | 0.05       | Switch to 100% Full | - ❌          |
| 5-20  | ON            | 0.006-0.008| 0.006-0.008| 0% early exits    | 14-15ms ❌     |

**This proves:**
1. The architecture CAN work (epochs 1-3)
2. Quality gates DESTROY it (epoch 4 onwards)
3. Once confidence crashes, it never recovers

## Recommended Actions Based on Phase Analysis

### Immediate (Do NOT Skip)

1. **Validate Phase 1.4 Detection Quality**
   ```bash
   # Must know: does it actually detect chairs correctly?
   python validate_phase1_4.py --compute-map
   ```

2. **Decision Point:**
   - If mAP > 0.30: Phase 1.4 might be acceptable as "fast mode"
   - If mAP < 0.20: Must retrain with proper anchor matching

### If Retraining (2-3 weeks)

3. **Start Clean:**
   - New training script with proper IoU-based anchor matching
   - Train baseline (no early exits) first
   - Validate mAP > 0.40 before adding complexity

4. **Add Early Exits:**
   - Use simplest approach from Phase 1.2/1.4
   - No quality gates during training
   - Measure detection quality at each exit

5. **Optimize Carefully:**
   - Add temperature clamping (learned from Phase 1.7/1.9)
   - Consider Phase 1.7's progressive scheduling (fastest result)
   - But avoid quality gates (proven to fail)

### If Pivoting

6. **Document Findings:**
   - "Negative result" for dissertation
   - Learning experience about training pitfalls
   - Contribution: what NOT to do

7. **Alternative Optimizations:**
   - Model pruning
   - Quantization
   - Neural Architecture Search
   - Other acceleration techniques

## Key Takeaways

1. **Simple > Complex:** Phases 1.2, 1.4, 1.7 (simple) worked. Phases 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, 1.9 (complex) failed.

2. **Quality Gates Are Poison:** Every phase with detection quality gates during inference failed to achieve early exits.

3. **Foundation Matters:** All phases share the same broken anchor matching. No amount of routing sophistication can fix broken detection.

4. **Validate Early:** We ran 9 phases before checking if the model detects anything. Should have validated in Phase 1.1.

5. **Temperature Clamping:** Essential (learned from Phases 1.7, 1.9). Without it, values explode.

6. **Warmup Insight:** Phase 1.9 proved the architecture works when quality gates are disabled.

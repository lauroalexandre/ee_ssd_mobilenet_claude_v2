# Decision Guide: What To Do Next

**Quick reference for deciding the path forward after training analysis**

---

## The Situation

You've completed 9 training phases. All failed to learn proper object detection due to **random anchor assignment** instead of IoU-based matching. The model predicts uniformly everywhere with confidence 0.41-0.46.

**You need to decide:** Continue with early exits, or pivot to a different approach?

---

## Decision Tree

```
START: Do you have time and resources for 2-3 weeks of retraining?
│
├─ YES → Go to Question 1
│
└─ NO  → Go to Question 3
```

### Question 1: Is early-exit object detection critical for your research?

**If YES (early exits are the main contribution):**
- **Action:** Option A - Complete Retrain (see below)
- **Timeline:** 2-3 weeks
- **Risk:** Medium (architecture proven, training needs fix)
- **Outcome:** Proper early-exit detector with 2-3x speedup

**If NO (early exits are one of several experiments):**
- **Action:** Option C - Research Pivot (see below)
- **Timeline:** Immediate
- **Risk:** Low (document findings, move on)
- **Outcome:** Negative result, focus on other optimizations

### Question 2: Can you validate Phase 1.4 quickly? (2-3 days)

**If YES:**
- **Action:** Option B - Quick Win (see below)
- **Timeline:** 3 days
- **Risk:** Low (just validation)
- **Outcome:** Know if Phase 1.4 is usable or must retrain

**If NO:**
- **Action:** Choose between Option A (retrain) or Option C (pivot)

### Question 3: What's your advisor's preference?

**Show them:**
- Executive Summary (`plans/EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md`)
- This decision guide

**Options to present:**
- **Fast path:** Validate Phase 1.4 (3 days)
- **Thorough path:** Retrain correctly (2-3 weeks)
- **Pivot:** Document as learning, try other methods

---

## Option A: Complete Retrain (Recommended if time permits)

### What You'll Do

**Week 1: Foundation**
```python
# 1. Implement proper anchor matching
# 2. Train baseline SSD (no early exits)
# 3. Validate: require mAP > 0.40
# 4. If fails: debug until it works
```

**Week 2: Early Exits**
```python
# 5. Add early exit branches to working baseline
# 6. Use simple threshold routing (like Phase 1.2)
# 7. No quality gates during training
# 8. Measure mAP at each exit point
```

**Week 3: Optimization**
```python
# 9. Add temperature clamping
# 10. Fine-tune thresholds
# 11. Compare with baseline and document
```

### Success Criteria
- Baseline mAP > 0.40 (week 1)
- Exit1 mAP > 0.30 (week 2)
- 2x speedup with <15% mAP drop (week 3)

### What You Get
- ✅ Proper working early-exit detector
- ✅ Valid speed/accuracy tradeoffs
- ✅ Strong contribution to dissertation
- ✅ Publishable results

### Risks
- May discover early exits aren't viable for multi-object detection
- Could take 3-4 weeks if issues arise
- Requires compute resources

### When to Choose This
- Early exits are your main research contribution
- You have 2-3 weeks available
- Advisor supports the timeline
- Compute resources available

---

## Option B: Quick Win (Validate First)

### What You'll Do

**Day 1: Setup**
```bash
# Create validation script
# Load Phase 1.4 model
# Prepare ground truth data
```

**Day 2: Compute Metrics**
```bash
# Run inference on validation set
# Compute: precision, recall, mAP, F1
# Generate: confusion matrix, error analysis
```

**Day 3: Analysis & Decision**
```bash
# Visualize: detection examples, failures
# Analyze: where it works, where it fails
# Decide: acceptable quality or need retrain?
```

### Decision Points

**If mAP > 0.35:**
```
✅ Phase 1.4 is acceptable for "fast mode"
→ Document limitations
→ Ship as "2x speedup with quality tradeoff"
→ Move to other research areas
```

**If mAP 0.25-0.35:**
```
⚠️ Borderline quality
→ Discuss with advisor
→ Consider if tradeoff is acceptable
→ May proceed to Option A for improvement
```

**If mAP < 0.25:**
```
❌ Quality too low
→ Must choose Option A (retrain) or Option C (pivot)
→ Phase 1.4 not usable
```

### What You Get
- ✅ Know current model's actual performance
- ✅ Make informed decision about next steps
- ✅ Only 3 days invested
- ✅ Visual examples for documentation

### Risks
- May reveal Phase 1.4 is completely broken (likely)
- Might still need to do Option A afterward
- 3 days could be spent directly on Option A

### When to Choose This
- Want to know before committing to retrain
- Phase 1.4 might be "good enough"
- Need evidence for advisor discussion
- Timeline is very tight

---

## Option C: Research Pivot

### What You'll Do

**Document the Negative Result:**
```markdown
# Include in dissertation:
1. What was attempted (9 training phases)
2. What went wrong (anchor matching, no validation)
3. What was learned (lessons for ML training)
4. Why you're pivoting (time/resource constraints)
```

**Choose Alternative Optimization:**
- Model pruning (remove redundant weights)
- Quantization (INT8 instead of FP32)
- Neural Architecture Search
- Knowledge distillation (different approach)
- Efficient backbone architectures

**Use Existing Resources:**
- Training infrastructure already built
- Dataset preparation done
- Validation pipeline exists
- Just apply to different optimization method

### What You Get
- ✅ Immediate progress on dissertation
- ✅ Valuable "what NOT to do" contribution
- ✅ Can still achieve speedup via other methods
- ✅ Demonstrates scientific rigor (reporting failures)

### Risks
- Might regret not fixing early exits
- Could be seen as "giving up"
- Removes a potential major contribution

### When to Choose This
- Timeline doesn't allow 2-3 week retrain
- Early exits were exploratory, not core
- Other methods might work better anyway
- Want to diversify research approaches

## Recommended Sequence

### Most Conservative Path
```
1. Start with Option B (3 days)
   ↓
2. If mAP > 0.30: Accept Phase 1.4, document, move on
   If mAP < 0.30: Proceed to Option A or C based on timeline
```

### Most Aggressive Path
```
1. Go straight to Option A (don't validate Phase 1.4)
   ↓
2. Fix foundation and retrain properly
   ↓
3. Get correct results in 2-3 weeks
```

### Pragmatic Path
```
1. Discuss with advisor (show analysis docs)
   ↓
2. Get guidance on timeline and priorities
   ↓
3. Choose option based on advisor input and constraints
```

## Questions to Ask Your Advisor

1. **Timeline:**
   - "Do we have 2-3 weeks for retraining?"
   - "Or should I validate quickly and move on?"

2. **Priorities:**
   - "Is early-exit detection critical for the thesis?"
   - "Or can I pivot to other optimization methods?"

3. **Resources:**
   - "Do we have compute budget for retraining?"
   - "Should I use existing models or start fresh?"

4. **Expectations:**
   - "What's acceptable mAP for early exits?"
   - "Is 2x speedup with 15% accuracy drop OK?"

5. **Risk Tolerance:**
   - "Should I take the safe path (validate) or aggressive (retrain)?"
   - "What if early exits don't work even after retraining?"

---

## My Recommendation

**Based on the analysis, I recommend:**

### For Most Cases: **Option B First**

**Reasoning:**
1. Only 3 days investment
2. Know the truth about Phase 1.4
3. Make informed decision after
4. Can still do Option A if needed

**Then:**
- If Phase 1.4 mAP > 0.30: Accept it, move on
- If Phase 1.4 mAP < 0.20: Discuss with advisor about Option A vs C

### For Committed Research: **Option A Directly**

**If:**
- Early exits are your main contribution
- You have 2-3 weeks clear
- Advisor supports the timeline
- Want to do it right

**Then:**
- Skip validation (we know it's broken)
- Go straight to proper retrain
- Build strong foundation first
- Get publishable results

### For Time-Constrained: **Option C**

**If:**
- Deadline is tight (< 2 weeks)
- Early exits were exploratory
- Other methods to try
- Want to diversify

**Then:**
- Document the negative result
- Move to alternative optimizations
- Come back to early exits later if time permits

```

### Option B (Validate)
```bash
# Quick validation of Phase 1.4
python validate_detection_quality.py \
    --model working/model_trained/early_exit_ssdlite_phase1_4_final.pth \
    --data subset_validation \
    --compute-map
```

### Option C (Pivot)
```bash
# Document current status
python generate_training_report.py --phases all

# Then choose alternative method
# (pruning, quantization, etc.)
```
